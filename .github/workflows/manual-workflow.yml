#
# GitHub Actions manual workflow.
#
# The main purpose of this workflow is to allow us (developers) to make
# quick changes to CI jobs without having to push them into the repository.
# This workflow file serves as a template that we can modify anytime that we
# need to experiment with new CI changes. The process to follow in those
# cases is fairly simple:
#
# 1. Create a topic-branch where to commit your changes (e.g. dev-branch).
#
# 2. Modify this file so that it looks as close as possible to the desired CI
#    job that will be eventually merged to the repo. Let's refer to this workflow
#    as a 'testing' workflow to differentiate it from the one in the 'master'
#    branch.
#
# 3. Head over to the 'actions' portal within the repo we're working on, and
#    click on the 'Manual Workflow". Then find the button "Run workflow" and
#    click on it. Finally, choose the branch over which our 'testing' workflow
#    was submitted.
#
# 4. Github will now run this latest 'testing' version of the workflow, and
#    not the one being stored in the master branch.
#
# 5. Repeat above cycle as many times as required, and when done, place the
#    workflow changes in a new file; do not make permanent changes to this
#    file as this one is just expected to serve as a template to ease our
#    live during CI definition & testing.
