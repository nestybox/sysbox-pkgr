# Increase keyring max-keys for scaling purposes.
#
# In debian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu) the kernel keyring max keys
# limit is set to 200 for non-root users.  This is too low for
# Sysbox. For example, for a sys container based K8s cluster, the
# number of keys required is:
#
#             keys = 35 + (k8s_workers * 23) + (2 * pods)
#
# That is, a 10-node cluster would need 282 keys.
#
# In a large bare-metal machine, we expect ~100 sys containers. That
# would consume ~11K keys.  To be conservative, we set maxkeys to
# 20K. Note that since each key consumes 20KB, the total mem
# consumption assuming all 20K keys are used is 400MB.
# In addition, maxbytes = 20 bytes * maxkeys.
