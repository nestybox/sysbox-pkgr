Type: boolean
Default: "true"
Description: Configure Docker service in 'userns-remap' mode?
 Your OS does not include the 'shiftfs' module. As a result, using Sysbox
 requires that you put Docker in 'userns-remap' mode. If you answer "yes"
 here, the installer will take care of this configuration process. Otherwise,
 you will be expected to do this manually. Please refer to Sysbox installation
 documentation for more details.
