Type: boolean
Default: "true"
Description: Configure Docker in userns-remap mode?
 Your OS does not include the shiftfs kernel module. As a result, for Docker
 to launch rootless containers with Sysbox you must configure Docker in userns-remap
 mode. If you answer "yes" here, the installer will take care of this configuration.
 Otherwise, you will need to do this manually. Refer to the Sysbox installation docs
 for more details.
